This project uses TypeScript for type safety and follows React Native best practices. The theme system provides consistent styling across the app.

### Folder Structure Guidelines

- **`/screens`**: Contains all screen components
- **`/components`**: Reusable UI components

2. Create basic screens (Home, Workout, Profile, Progress)
3. Implement core components
4. Add state management
5. Integrate AI features
